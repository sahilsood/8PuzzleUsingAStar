Solving the 8-puzzle using A* algorithm

Implemented A* search algorithm to formulate a 8-puzzle problem using Python.

In addition to coding of A* algorithm, the state space representation, the
operators, the g (cost) and TWO h (heuristic) functions of the 8-puzzle problem is also implemented. The program
accepts different initial and goal states as input from users and generate the best
solution path as output. In addition, 

(1) the number of nodes generated, and 
(2) the number of nodes expanded, in your output for both heuristic functions.
